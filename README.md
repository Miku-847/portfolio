# Personal Portfolio

**Live site:** https://miku-847.github.io/Portfolio/

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing a selection of projects I’ve built while studying Computer Science.

The site is built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, with project content rendered dynamically from JavaScript to keep the structure clean and easy to maintain.

## Features
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Dynamic project rendering from a structured data file
- Clean, minimal UI focused on readability
- Subtle hover and interaction effects
- Custom cursor for desktop devices
